# About Me

I am a MSc student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) studying Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning, and will complete the program in Sept. 2022. My thesis is in conjunction with AstraZeneca on investigating methodology for addressing competing risks in survival analysis. I earned my BS in biomedical engineering at the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu/), with emphases in bioinformatics and pre-med. 

In two past summers, I conducted research in two labs: Georgia Institute of Technology/Emory University School of Medicine and University of Missouri. 

My interests lie in leveraging data in any setting, within or beyond healthcare. It is exciting to think about the endless ways I can apply my skillset to drive change in our Information Age!

When the laptop is closed, I am a content creator. I apply these skills as the founding creator for [Imperial College's official Tikok](https://www.tiktok.com/@imperialcollege) and also my personal Tiktok (52.6k followers). I enjoy dancing which I did through teams in both undergrad and graduate school. I also enjoy playing tennis, modeling, and sketching. 

# Projects 
Clinician Burnout Project (06/2020- 05/2021):  
We hypothesize that Electronic Medical Record (EMR) use metrics by physician correlate to physician burnout risk and remodeling the EMR workflow with be an interventional method to reduce burnout risk factors. I cleaned the raw data of over 5000 clinicians and utilized descriptive statistics, kmeans, and PCA clustering as part of exploratory analysis.

SemNet (05/2019 - 08/2019):  
The objective of this study is to identify and rank associative factors related to angiogenesis, fibrosis, and EF using an innovative literature mining approach, SemNet. I interpreted the SemNet's network analysis data and visualized node connectivity for presentation. I also drafted the first 20 pages of the project's manuscript, which is still ongoing by the team. It is soon to be submitted for publishing with my name as an author.
